# Chuck Norris Joke App

This project is for recreation on frontend internship.
Skeleton of the app was generated by created-react-app.
This app in React and TypeScript.
For code quality I use eslint + airbnb config.
For jokes, I use api: [ http://www.icndb.com/api/](http://www.icndb.com/api/).

## Run dev server 
`npm start`

## Build project
`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
