# Chuck Norris Joke App

This project is for recruitment on frontend internship position.
Base structure of the app was generated by created-react-app.
This app was made in React and TypeScript.
For code quality I use eslint + airbnb style guide.
Icon of a man is  source from [Google Material Icon](https://fonts.google.com/icons).
For drawing jokes I used : [ http://www.icndb.com/api/](http://www.icndb.com/api/).

## Run dev server
